# ideon

<br>

## Description

This is an app to post project ideas with a short description, tags, labels, categories, upvote or downvote them and comment. Made for helpless UX/UI designers and developers who have no idea what to do as exercises. We believe that every TODO React app kills aprox. 2.7 baby dolphins. Save the dolphins. Try ideon.
